# BALAUR Framework General Rules

This rule provides general guidance for working with the BALAUR framework.

## Description
When working with any file in the BALAUR framework, follow these guidelines:

## Files
*.ts, *.js, *.md, *.json

## Instructions
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- Follow the HATEOAS principles in all resource implementations
- Keep the codebase minimal with no external dependencies beyond Deno standards
- Use explicit return types on all functions and methods
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Document public APIs with concise JSDoc comments
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables/methods
- Ensure all code follows the established architecture patterns
- Remember this is a hypermedia-driven framework for LLM-UI applications
- All resources should have proper links to guide possible actions
